## Configuration for Claude Desktop

You will need to supply a configuration for the server for your MCP Client. Here's what the configuration looks like for [claude_desktop_config.json](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user):

```
{
    "mcpServers": {
        
        "filesystem": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "-y",
                "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
                "."
            ]
        },
        
        "research": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": ["run", "research_server.py"]
        },
        
        "fetch": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]
